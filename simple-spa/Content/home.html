        The Vancouver Optimist Club located in Vancouver, WA. USA, is committed to &quot;Bringing Out the Best
        in Kids&quot;.&nbsp; The Vancouver club sponsors youth projects to
        serve our community for benefit of the young people.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chartered in 1946,
        the Vancouver club is the oldest OI service club in the Pacific
        Northwest District of Optimist International.&nbsp; Our goal has been
        and continues to be to make a difference in
        the lives of our children.

        The Vancouver Optimist Club Foundation has a 43 acre youth camp on the
        Lewis River.&nbsp; Any youth group (Scouts, Church Youth Groups and
        so on) may use the camp. The camp has been enhanced by
        several youth projects (Boys and Girl scouts groups, Eagle scout
        projects, etc) at the camp over the years.

        We support a JOOI (Junior Optimist Octagon International) Club
        called the M.O.B. (Mentors of Boys).&nbsp; Our membership enjoys our
        work parties at the youth camp with this great group of young
        men.

        In addition to the youth camp, yearly events include local essay
        and oratorical contests, youth appreciation and respect for
        law.&nbsp; We welcome new projects that can support the youth of
        our community.

        Cancer.&nbsp; This is usually held in June.
