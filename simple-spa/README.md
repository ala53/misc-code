# Simple Single Page App

A small single page application implemented without really using any framework.
Just put the HTML + CSS + JS for a single page in a subfolder and point a link
to it. The program will handle the rest (converting to hashbang #!/XYZ links).
Has a fancy transitional loading screen but really isn't useful for anything.
